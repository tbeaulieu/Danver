# Danver
 QML dashboard for the GARW unit, based upon the Ridge Racer 6/7 Danver Tachometer

 Contains a custom made font (Greddy Segment), based upon the Greddy Sirius Unify. All rights reserved. :) 

Change line 171/172 commenting in Danver.qml for chunky vs smooth RPM behavior. Make sure you don't have both there at the same time, or it'll bomb your dash.
